DOCUMENTATION

The header files of the HB-Lattice code have been annotated with Doxygen style 
comments, on which an online reference manual for the source code is based. The 
documentation can be found at:

http://abeln.bitbucket.org/HB-Lattice/

Alternatively, you may compile the documentation using Doxygen, and the 
Doxyfile in the source folder.


SOURCE

The source code for the simulation and design of the HB-Lattice model can be 
found in the /source folder

The code may be compiled using the Makefile provided in the source folder.

RUNNING THE SIMULATION

The executable may be run using the shell scripts in runScripts folder. In 
simulation.sh several examples of command line options may be given. Command 
line options are listed in the source file App.cpp

ANALYSIS

Some python based analysis scripts are provided in the analysis folder
    

DOWNLOAD

The code is kept in a public git repository on BitBucket.org
The latest version of the code may be downloaded from:

http://bitbucket.org/abeln/hb-lattice/get/master.tar.gz

The repository may be accessed from:

INSTALLATION REQUIREMENTS

To compile this code, Open MPI libraries need to be installed. We have 
successfully compiled the code both on Linux or Mac like platforms. Note that 
depending on your type of mpi installation, the finalize command in ptemp.cpp 
may need to be removed.
